# How To Submit Your Coursework

Use Git & Github to submit your coursework as a pull request. Follow the pull request workflow defined in the repo you are working on. Repos and projects usually have a specific defined way to open your PR so it's important that you read and follow the individual guidelines.

The Github Desktop cheatsheet will help you.

## Questions & Help

Contributing to a remote codebase is a necessary skill for a professional developer. Opening PRs is mandatory at CYF. It is part of the coursework.

If you cannot submit your coursework you **must** post on Slack to get unblocked.
